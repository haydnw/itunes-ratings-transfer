# itunes-ratings-transfer
Transfer star ratings from an old iTunes Media Library to a new one
(i.e. between XML files).

Originated from work [in a gist](https://gist.github.com/reinout/4410653)
by [Reinout van Rees](http://reinout.vanrees.org).

Modified by [Haydn Williams](http://github.com/haydnw) to ignore new
ratings and just import all old ratings from the old library.
