# itunes-ratings-transfer
Transfer star ratings from an old iTunes Media Library to a new one
(*i.e.* between XML files).

Originated from work [in a gist](https://gist.github.com/reinout/4410653)
relating to a [blog post](http://reinout.vanrees.org/weblog/2012/12/30/restore-itunes-ratings.html)
by [Reinout van Rees](http://reinout.vanrees.org).

Modified by [Haydn Williams](http://github.com/haydnw) to ignore new
ratings and just import all old ratings from the old library.

Note that the .xml file generated by Python 2.7.6 doesn't quite seem
to work with iTunes 12.2.0.145, so you may need to export an existing
Playlist from iTunes and then manually edit the first few lines of
XML to ensure that they match what iTunes currently generates. The
file should import fine after that though.
